It is now a requirement for Basketball England that our Association and Clubs appoint a Club Welfare Officer who has a particular responsibility for the safeguarding of young people playing basketball. Brian Steele EKBA Chairman/Secretary will fulfil the role of Club Welfare Officer for East Kent. Clubs who have junior players or run Junior training sessions should also appoint their own Club Welfare Officer(s). The following outlines the responsibility of a Welfare Officer (provided by Basketball England)<br>
Contact Details for Brian Steele: <a href="mailto:bsteele4@sky.com?subject=EKBA">bsteele4@sky.com</a> <a href="tel:07905489066">07905489066</a><br><br>

The Club Welfare Officer (CWO) is a key designated role. It is essential to ensure that the club has someone trained and supported to handle any welfare issue that may arise and all clubs with young people are advised to appoint at least one Club Welfare Officer (also referred to as a Child Protection Officer). <br>
Safeguarding involves not only protecting young people, but to educating club members on the latest good practice guidelines and what to do if they are concerned that abuse may be taking place elsewhere in the child's life. They do not need to be a child protection 'expert' as that is the role of the statutory agencies (Police and Children's Social Care).  <br>
A club may appoint more than one Club Welfare Officer and Clubmark requires two appointed Club Welfare Officers. The Club Welfare Officer needs to be supported by their club's management and ideally should have a formal role on the club management committee as safeguarding is everyone's responsibility.   <br>
