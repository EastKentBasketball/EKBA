		2023/2024 saw a successful EKYBL (youth league) - Congratulationss to
		the organisers for this great development!
	</li>

		More trained officials are needed, therefore another referee course shall
		be held, and we would like volunteers.
	</li>

		Pre-season 3v3 would also benefit the league in the off season and the

	extremely healthy. Also, EKBA now has an online account so payment monitoring
	should run a lot smoother.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks to the treasurer for their dedicated work.

		Executive Committee to discuss further fees and invoices for BACS payments.
	</li>
	<li>
		Teams must provide EKBA with details of all players licenses before competitions
		begin. preferably with ‘head shots’ and head shots should ideally be available
		on a team sheet at each game!
	</li>
	<li>
		Individual Affiliations for men’s competitions: Discussed regarding national
		league players with clubs outside EKBA playing in the EKBL. Agreed that
		clubs should be allowed a maximum of 3 senior national league players in
		their team.

		Players eligibility for Men’s Cup competitions was discussed: Agreed that
		for a player to be able to play in the Cup they will have had to play 3
		games in the league before Dec 31st. Allowances may be considered by Executive
		Committee if a player had been unable to play due to injury/illness.
	</li>
	<li>
		League Formation Men’s: Proposed that we should run 2 Men’s Leagues which
		would allow fairer competition and allow for development of young players
		and give all players more court time. This would be dependent on sufficient
		entries and Executive Committee would make a final decision based on entries.
		Agreed unanimously. 2 Men’s Leagues for 2024/2025 intended. If two leagues,
		each league will have its own cup competitions run in the same way as Women’s
		Cup.
