	<p>Folkestone Saints 32 - 37 Herne Bay.</p>
	<p>In a dramatic first match of the day, Herne Bay's women's team saw off Folkestone Saints to win the Grove Cup 3rd/4th place play-off match for the 3rd consecutive time since the fixture was added to the finals day roster.</p>
	<p>Dominating the first two quarters the Bay went 20-10 ahead at half time, and Sam Lee made it a 16 point lead in the 3rd. However Saints responded to level the scores with just three minutes of the game remaining. Tough defence from the Bay broke the Saints offencive rhythm and two quick buckets from Carly Vincent saw the Bay secure victory in this closely contested game.</p>
	<p>Match MVP: Cara Shaw (Folkestone Saints)</p>
