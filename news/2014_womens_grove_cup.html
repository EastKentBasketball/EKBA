	<p>Herne Bay 47 - 53 Canterbury Crusaders</p>
	<p>The Women’s Grove Cup final saw League winners, and an unbeaten Canterbury Crusaders team take on a rejuvenated Herne Bay side in a superb game of basketball.</p>
	<p>The game started at great pace and intensity with the lead changing hands on five occasions. Crusaders Emma Loane played with great determination and effort, and she opened the scoring by driving strongly to the hoop. Herne Bay responded with Sarah Cooper and a three from Captain Clare Reed, 5-2. Crusaders hit back with Loane again, and Danielle Muckian with a three of her own as they went 7-5 ahead. Herne Bay stepped up and dominated the Crusaders boards with some excellent rebounding to feed Kristina Skaburskyte and Barbara Tocco, who struck to retake the lead at 10-7. Crusaders dug deep and found space in the Bay zone. Elizabeth Awonusi scored at close range and Millie Mae Hammond fought hard for the loose ball to lift the Crusaders side with consecutive baskets giving her side a cushion at 19-13. Fortunately for Crusaders, Herne Bay squandered their opportunities from the foul line and Carla Meijen rounded off the quarter hitting a three to take them 22-13 ahead.</p>
	<p>Crusaders ran off seven unanswered points at the start of the 2nd quarter with a three from Zainya Reyes and further baskets from the excellent Emma Loane. However, Herne Bay hit back with Skaburskyte, Cooper and Tocco all hitting the target to keep them in touch. Benita Palmer and Reyes scored from the top of the key giving Crusaders a fourteen margin at 35-21, but they couldn’t keep Herne Bay down as they conceded four points making it 25-35 at the break.</p>
	<p>The third quarter was totally dominated by Herne Bay who almost shut out Crusaders. They defended particularly well and closed down Crusaders play maker Zainya Reyes who was stripped of the ball trying to penetrate the Bay zone. This exposed the Crusaders defence to the quick break. Herne Bay’s Lesley Kay scored from the side and when Kerri Davies hit her second free-throw, she pegged the score line back to 31-35. Danielle Muckian finally broke the drought for Crusaders, but Herne Bay still had the momentum. Crusaders turned the ball over in the final seconds and Carly Vincent scored on the buzzer which brought a huge roar from the crowd as Herne Bay went in just three points behind at 34-37.</p>
	<p>The final quarter wasn’t for the feint hearted as the game entered the closing stages. Zainya Reyes struck first for Crusaders, but Herne Bay hit back with vengeance and brought the scores level within three minutes at 39-39. Their tough defence had worked well but it came at a cost as they fell into foul trouble early on. Crusaders went to the line with Awonusi and Reyes putting away two from four, and when Danielle Muckian hit a three Crusaders appeared to be regaining ascendancy. However Herne Bay wouldn’t lie down and Tocco hit four consecutive points as they came right back into it at 43-44. Danielle Muckian hit yet another three pointer and Emma Loane with two gave Crusaders a 49-43 lead with two minutes remaining. Still Herne Bay wouldn’t concede defeat and an amazing ‘coast to coast’ drive from Clare Reed brought the crowd to its feet as she brought it back to a one basket game. Crusaders took to running down the clock and Herne Bay gave away fouls trying to regain possession. Unfortunately for them they chose to foul Muckian, who took maximum advantage from the line, four from four. Time ran out for Herne Bay and Crusaders took the Cup to add to their League triumph. Muckian’s outstanding final’s performance with a game high 18 points was recognised by the match adjudicators and she rightly took the game MVP award.</p>
