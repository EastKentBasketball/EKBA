The strength of the Tenterden team is that they don’t rely on just one or two players for points; this was evidenced in their first quarter performance as they went 16-10 ahead with Adam Simmonds, Courtney Fraser-Bates, George Fuller, Craig Thompson and Patrick Irankunda all getting onto the score sheet. Fortunately for Saints they had the superb Tyler Russell whose 10 first quarter points kept them in touch with the opening quarter finishing with Tenterden 20-15 ahead.</p>	<p>The 2nd quarter was hard fought and finished 16-16 with both teams competing for every loose ball and rebound. Saints veteran Paul Kennedy hit six points from close range, supported by Max Carpenter who hit four as Tenterden continued to trouble them, despite some great defensive blocks from Tyler Russell. The strength of the Tenterden bench was displayed as Lance Digby, Colin Riley, Adam Morris and Nathaniel Fournillier all added their name to the Tornados scoring. Matt Carpenter kept Saints in touch with a three pointer as the teams went in at the half with Tenterden five points ahead at 36-31.</p>	<p>Tenterden extended their lead to eight points as Craig Thompson hit a three. Saints hit back with six unanswered points but consecutive three pointers from Tenterden’s Frazer-Bates and Thompson cancelled it out. Matt Carpenter hit five consecutive points for Saints but Tenterden were on a roll and it was Frazer-Bates again hitting the target, and with another three he put his team ten points ahead at 54-44. Tenterden had the chance to go further ahead but failed from both free shots. Saints Matt Carpenter hit the final basket of the quarter to keep them in touch at 46-54.</p>	<p>The final quarter saw Tenterden defending a strong Saints fight back. Tyler Russell brought it back to 54-58 and just as everyone thought the game was swinging their way Tenterden’s Digby and Fournillier restored their eight point lead. Saints then found inspiration through Steve Thomas who hit a basket and then one from two from the foul line. Russell added another two and suddenly it was a three point game. Tenterden’s Mike Millar was fouled on his way to the hoop and making one of his free shots the Tornado’s kept a four point lead. Saints responded through Tyler Russell who also hit one from two on top of a single basket and suddenly it was a one point game. Tenterden failed to score on their possession and Matt Carpenter put Saints ahead for the first time since the second minute of the game with just a minute remaining. It was a matter of nerve as the game entered the final moments. Tenterden came down court with what could be their final possession of the ball needing to score. The noise level from the crowd was deafening as Saints defended their slender advantage. Under pressure a Tenterden player was called for a travelling violation and the ball went to Saints who clearly just had to hold onto the ball. Tenterden had to foul to stop the clock but it was game MVP Tyler Russell who took the resulting free shots. He made all his shots and Saints won the Cup in the most dramatic of ways leaving a valiant Tenterden team looking how they had failed to win it themselves.</p>
