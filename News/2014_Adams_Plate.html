	<p>Whitstable 91 - 79 Herne Bay</p>
	<p>The EKBA Finals Day 2014 took place at Kings School Recreation Centre on Saturday 26th April and produced a day of high drama in a noisy fan packed arena.</p>
	<p>The day kicked off with a ‘local derby’ in the Adams Plate Final between League runners up Whitstable against Herne Bay. The Bay took an early 6-2 lead but Whitstable responded with an outstanding display of shooting from Captain James Harris who sank 11 consecutive points from the top of the key. Julian Naci added further points for Whitstable as Herne Bay struggled to keep in touch. Only Rafa Sojczynski was able to make any impression for the Bay, but with Barney Loades draining another three, it wasn’t enough to stop Whitstable taking a big 36-17 1st quarter lead.</p>
	<p>The 2nd quarter opened with a ‘trey’ from Herne Bay’s Gareth Oliver, but it sparked another 11 point run from Whitstable who appeared to be heading out of sight. Herne Bay dug deep via Ezra McKenzie, Tom Hedley Smith and Gareth Oliver who, with another ‘three,’ pulled it back to 39-50. However James Harris and Kelvin Sandhu still found time in the final minute to hit a further four points as the half finished 54-39 in Whitstable’s favour.</p>
	<p>Whitstable totally dominated the third quarter, taking it 31-13 with James Harris and Julian Naci again finding the hoop with precision shooting. Some great defence from Dan Harris denied Herne Bay any room in the key and they had to pick up what scraps they could from outside. Whitstable’s Sam Bell, Nick Moore, all got in on the score sheet and Fraser Greenaway ended the quarter with a buzzer beating 3 pointer as Whitstable went in at the end of the 3rd quarter with a huge 33 point lead at 85-52.</p>
	<p>Whitstable took their foot off the gas in the final quarter and ran the bench. Herne Bay took full advantage to take the final quarter 27-6. Paul Steele took his game total to 21 points, but it was never going to be enough as Whitstable added the Adam’s Plate to their trophy cabinet.</p>
